# Satellite-Images-Classification
The aim of our project is to explore the ’Satellite Images’ dataset and develop a model to clas sify its images by using and comparing two techniques: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)  and Logistic Regression.  The goal was to recognize images from a satellite and identify four key elements: Clouds, Deserts, Green areas, and Water.

The repository contains the Code, the presentation and the report used in this group project.
